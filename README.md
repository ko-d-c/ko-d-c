## Profile

I work on **enterprise AI and digital transformation** projects where  
business processes, organizational constraints, and technical systems meet.

My focus is on:
- developing the right strategy
- structuring ambiguous problems
- translating domain logic into computable form
- prototyping internal tools and process AI
- leading development cycles and change management
Because...
> Most AI initiatives fail *before* implementation.

## Worlds Stack
I build structures **upstream of code** to reduce that risk. The technical worlds I have travel experience in:

| Tool | Usage context |
|---|---|
| RAG | vector database inputs, chunking strategy |
| Python | prototyping, analysis, AI agents |
| SQL | structured querying of operational data |
| JavaScript | interactive internal tools, server setup |
| PowerBI | documentation & knowledge design |

## Past Journeys

### 🚀 Journey 1 — Finance  
**Destination:** Accessible, strategy-oriented investment guidance

> **Guiding question:**  
> *Can modern AI systems translate complex investment logic into recipient-oriented guidance for people without privileged access to financial education or advisory services?*

<table>
<tr>
<td width="70%">

**Project placeholder — Investment Strategy Advisor**

An AI-assisted advisory prototype designed to help individuals  
discover investment strategies that match their goals, constraints,  
and risk profiles — without requiring expert financial literacy.

**Focus of this journey**
- translating professional investment logic into understandable guidance  
- recipient-oriented communication instead of one-size-fits-all advice  
- aligning strategy, risk, and long-term objectives  
- making financial decision support more inclusive and approachable

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Means of travel**
- Python (strategy logic, simulations)
- RAG (financial knowledge grounding)
- SQL (portfolio and scenario data)
- LLMs (adaptive, recipient-oriented explanations)

### 🌱 Journey 2 — Sustainability & ESG  
**Destination:** Structured insight across competing advocacy perspectives

> **Guiding question:**  
> *Can AI help decision-makers navigate sustainability debates by making different advocacy perspectives explicit, comparable, and transparent?*

<table>
<tr>
<td width="70%">

**Project placeholder — ESG Advocacy Perspective Advisor**

An AI agent designed to represent and contrast the perspectives  
of different sustainability advocacy groups when evaluating policies,  
projects, or corporate strategies.

**Focus of this journey**
- surfacing value conflicts and trade-offs in ESG debates  
- translating qualitative advocacy positions into structured arguments  
- supporting more informed, pluralistic decision-making  
- increasing transparency in sustainability discussions

**Means of travel**
- Python (logic and orchestration)
- RAG (policy texts, advocacy statements)
- Vector databases (perspective retrieval)
- Prompt design (role-consistent reasoning)
- Visualization tools (comparison and contrast)
